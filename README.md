# RockPaperScissors
Fully Functional Rock Paper Scissors Game in Python

This Game comes in 4 modes:

1) Beginner
2) Intermediate
3) Expert
4) Super Hard

Beginner is only doing it randomly. Intermediate uses a particular AI Algorithm based on common player psychology. Expert uses a butchering of the Markov Chain Concept to allow the Machine to adapt to player strategies and accurately predict their next pick. Super hard is well... Super hard.

Look out for an easter egg btw... BAZINGA!!! :)
